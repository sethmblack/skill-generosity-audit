# Generosity Audit

A MacKenzie Scott methodology for identifying hoarded resources that are becoming "ashes" and discovering where releasing them would generate greater value.

---


## When to Use

- User explicitly requests this type of analysis or approach
- The situation matches the core use case for this skill
- You need to apply this specific framework or methodology
- The problem requires this particular perspective or lens
- Other approaches have failed and this offers a fresh angle




## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |

## Purpose

Resources hoarded become resources lost. Money, knowledge, connections, opportunities—held too tightly, they decay. This skill audits what you're holding back, identifies where withholding is costing more than releasing would, and creates a plan to let go generatively.

---

## When to Invoke

**Trigger phrases:**
- "What am I hoarding?"
- "Generosity audit"
- "Is my safe filling with ashes?"
- "What should I give away?"
- "Where am I holding too tightly?"

**Situations:**
- Feeling scarcity despite having resources
- Noticing you've accumulated but not shared
- Sensing that your resources aren't generating value
- Struggling to be generous despite wanting to be
- Recognizing you've been "saving for later" indefinitely
- Any moment of questioning whether holding is serving you

---

## Input Requirements

Provide:
1. **Resources you hold** - What do you have? (money, knowledge, connections, time, opportunities, influence)
2. **Your concerns about giving** - What worries you about releasing these resources?
3. **Desired outcomes** - What do you ultimately want to achieve or enable?

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: Inventory Your Safe

What resources are you holding?

**Resource categories:**
| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Financial** | Savings, investments, assets, discretionary spending capacity |
| **Knowledge** | Expertise, insights, information, skills, lessons learned |
| **Relational** | Connections, networks, introductions you could make |
| **Temporal** | Time, attention, availability, presence |
| **Opportunity** | Chances you could offer others, platforms, visibility |
| **Positional** | Influence, authority, decision rights you could share |

For each category, ask:
- What do I have that others could benefit from?
- What am I holding that I haven't shared?
- What have I accumulated that isn't flowing outward?

### Step 2: Identify the Hoarding

Hoarding isn't just having—it's having while others lack and you don't share.

**Hoarding indicators:**
- You have more than you need for security
- You could give without meaningful sacrifice
- You've been "planning to give" but haven't
- You find reasons to wait for "the right time"
- Your resources are sitting, not working
- You feel protective of things beyond their utility

**The Dillard question (via MacKenzie Scott):**
> "The impulse to save something good for a better place later is the signal to spend it now."

When you catch yourself saving "for later," that's often the sign that now is the time.

### Step 3: Assess the Ash Risk

Resources hoarded can turn to ash—losing value through non-use.

**How resources decay:**
| Resource | How It Becomes Ash |
|----------|-------------------|
| Money | Inflation erodes; opportunities missed; you can't take it with you |
| Knowledge | Becomes outdated; stays locked in your head when it could help others |
| Connections | Relationships atrophy without mutual benefit; introductions unmade help no one |
| Time | Every day not given is gone forever |
| Opportunities | Chances not offered to others are chances lost entirely |
| Influence | Authority not used to help others is authority wasted |

**Ash risk assessment:**
For each hoarded resource, ask:
- What is this resource doing right now?
- What value is it generating while I hold it?
- What would happen if I held it another year? Five years?
- What opportunities are being missed while I wait?

> "Anything you do not give freely and abundantly becomes lost to you. You open your safe and find ashes."

### Step 4: Identify Generative Potential

Where would releasing create more value than holding?

**Generosity is generative:** Giving creates ripple effects that multiply value beyond the original gift.

**Generative potential questions:**
- Who could benefit from what I'm holding?
- What could they do with it that I'm not doing?
- What might they go on to give to others?
- How might this gift ripple outward?

**The ripple principle (from MacKenzie Scott):**
> "Whose generosity did I think of when I made every one of the hundreds of gifts I've given so far? It was the local dentist who offered me free dental work when he saw me securing a broken tooth with denture glue in college."

Your gift becomes part of a chain. The recipients of your generosity will give to others. You cannot predict or control this—but you can participate in it.

### Step 5: Confront Your Fears

What's really keeping you from giving?

**Common fears and their reframes:**
| Fear | Reframe |
|------|---------|
| "I might need it later" | You likely won't, and if you do, you'll adapt. Scarcity mindset is rarely predictive. |
| "They might misuse it" | Your judgment of "proper use" is not superior. Trust their expertise about their needs. |
| "I worked hard for this" | Yes, and countless others contributed to your ability to earn it. Wealth is collective. |
| "It won't make a difference" | Every gift ripples. You cannot see where it goes, but it goes somewhere. |
| "I don't know where to give" | Start somewhere imperfect. Movement beats paralysis. |
| "I'm not ready" | The impulse to wait is the signal to act. Readiness is a trap. |

### Step 6: Design the Release

How will you move from hoarding to giving?

**Release design principles:**
- **Start now, not later** - "I will keep at it until the safe is empty"
- **Give freely** - Without conditions that recapture control
- **Give abundantly** - More than feels comfortable
- **Trust the recipient** - They know their needs better than you
- **Release attachment** - Once given, it's not yours; let go of outcomes

**Practical steps:**
1. Choose one resource category to address first
2. Identify a specific recipient (or type of recipient)
3. Determine what you'll give and when
4. Remove conditions—give freely
5. Act before the impulse fades
6. Notice how it feels, then repeat

## Example Application

**Input:**
"I've built up expertise in my field over 20 years. I'm often asked to mentor younger people but I'm selective because my time is limited. I also have a network of contacts I've cultivated carefully. And I have savings I keep adding to, though I'm already secure. What am I hoarding?"

**Analysis:**

**Resource Inventory:**
- **Knowledge:** 20 years of field expertise, lessons learned, patterns recognized
- **Relational:** Carefully cultivated network of contacts
- **Financial:** Savings beyond security needs
- **Temporal:** Time for mentoring (limited, guarded)

**Hoarding Identification:**
- **Knowledge:** You're being "selective" about sharing—holding expertise when you could distribute it
- **Relational:** Network is "carefully cultivated"—for what? If connections aren't being made, they're not generating value
- **Financial:** Adding to savings beyond security = pure accumulation
- **Temporal:** "Limited time" is everyone's condition; selectivity here is a choice to withhold

**Ash Risk Assessment:**
- **Knowledge:** Expertise unshared helps no one. When you retire or leave the field, unshared knowledge is lost.
- **Relational:** Contacts unexploited for mutual benefit become stale. Introductions unmade create no value.
- **Financial:** Money beyond security earning modest returns while people and causes need it now.
- **Temporal:** Every day you could mentor but don't is a day permanently lost.

**Generative Potential Map:**
- **Knowledge:** A young professional you mentor might go on to mentor ten others. Your expertise multiplies through them.
- **Relational:** Introductions create connections that generate value you'll never see but is real.
- **Financial:** A donation to an effective organization does more good than your savings account interest.
- **Temporal:** An hour with an emerging leader may shape a 30-year career.

**Fear Inventory and Reframes:**
- "I'm selective because my time is limited" - Everyone's time is limited. This is choosing to hoard what could help others.
- "I cultivated this network carefully" - For what purpose? A network that doesn't flow value is a collection, not an asset.
- "I might need those savings" - You said you're already secure. This is scarcity thinking, not planning.

**Release Plan:**

1. **This week (Knowledge):** Say yes to the next mentoring request that comes, regardless of fit. Start flowing expertise outward.

2. **This month (Relational):** Make three introductions between people in your network who would benefit from knowing each other. Expect nothing in return.

3. **This quarter (Financial):** Identify an organization doing work you believe in. Give an amount that feels slightly uncomfortable—beyond your usual level. Give unrestricted.

4. **Ongoing (Temporal):** Block two hours per month as "generous time"—available to whoever needs you. First come, first served. Stop being selective.

5. **Mindset shift:** When you feel the impulse to save something good for later, treat it as the signal to give it now.

## Core Principle

> "I will keep at it until the safe is empty... Anything you do not give freely and abundantly becomes lost to you. You open your safe and find ashes." — MacKenzie Scott

Generosity is generative. What you release multiplies. What you hoard decays. Open the safe.
